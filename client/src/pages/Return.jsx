        At Maddkit, we want your celebrations to be smooth and stress-free.
<br />
✅ Refunds will be provided under the following scenarios:
<br />
If the delivered product is incorrect
<br />
If the delivered product is damaged
<br />
If the customer cancels the order within the allowed window
<br />
If Maddkit cancels the order due to any unforeseen reasons
<br />
Cancellations are allowed within 24 hours of placing the order. If your order hasn't been shipped, we’ll cancel and refund it in full. If it has already been dispatched, you can refuse the delivery. Your refund will be processed once the product returns to our warehouse.
<br />
Once the product reaches our warehouse, a quality check will be conducted (typically within 5–7 working days). After this, refunds are processed to the original payment method within another 5–7 working days.
<br />
For any questions, reach out to us at maddkitofficial@gmail.com — we’re here to help make every celebration brighter.
